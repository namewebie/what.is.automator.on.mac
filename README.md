Automator is a macOS application that lets you automate your workflows to save time. You can create Automator workflows and run them with the click of a button. Apple first introduced Automator with Mac OS X Tiger in 2005.

It is one of the best macOS default apps, and it is also among the more underappreciated ones. The geeky interface might confuse you just by the looks of it, but using Automator on Mac doesn’t require any programming or scripting skills. On the contrary, you can use its vast library to combine your repetitive actions with a single command.


## How does the Automator app on Mac work?

There’s no limit to what you can do on Automator. Here is a vast list of actions connected to the app on your Mac. All you have to do is arrange the actions into a workflow and save it. Then when you need to use all those commands again, use the workflow and save time.

The above video is an excellent video tutorial for Automator. Apple has also created a series of Automator tutorials that you can use to understand the app better.
